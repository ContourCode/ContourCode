Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
Just a teen dev who spends 90% of my life staring at a screen and survives on tea (coffee is poison)! Aeronautical physics is fun, spend a lot of time trying to create flight sims. You can find me on Scratch [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/contourlines) I would put a website link here but I can't be bothered to make one...
If your interested, I happen to know C++, Python, NodeJS, normal JS (HTML and CSS too but they don't really count imo), Scratch. I tried to learn C, BrainF, Java, C# and a load of other random languages but I either got bored or found it too hard and gave up!
